Exactly! There are times where I feel like a super creep for posting so much.But that could also be my brain being over analyzing things 
Jokes aside, being fan of an actor & showing your love for their work is different from stalking them. So I wouldn't consider you a creep. 
Don't thank me, I'm just pointing out the obvious. But I'm glad that I made someone (you) feel better today. So I guess that's my reward.

I'd say this about my twin. It's pretty normal to be an ass to them honestly. 
I LOVE THAT GUY!!!!!!  I can so relate!  I also love the guy who grabs his glasses and suddenly puts them on like "NO WAY!!! Is that who I think it is???"  
That guy in the middle didn’t even know he was 
That's up to them. I think they're fine just the way they are. Marriage doesn't make you love someone anymore than you already do. Although, I would love to see that.

Nothing will beat it, the closest thing is the first flood encounter on 343 guilty spark. Scared the shit outa me 
You got to be kidding me , this was obviously a joke . The fact that you posted it as a reply not once but Twice , Makes you the joke 
Right! Does he do the same shit to kids watching a puppet show? It's not real! 
You don't have a clue Ted
 I’m out of touch cos I don’t watch wrestling!!! Good one! Please tell me more of these predetermined sports that you watch.
 All aspects of pro wrestling are fake! The only part that is real are the injuries and even that is questionable at times. If you think a multi billion $ business will leave anything to chance then you are the idiot! Everything you see is planned & coordinated. Simples!
hehe jim carrey i love you 
Just take my money now

I don’t have £50 to splash around 
So we’re completely ignoring contractual obligations here? Like we’re just totally throwing the legal stuff out the window because you think she could have easily disagreed? 
I agree the items are not worth £50 and I would never pay it, and I am also not a fan girl 
Boots have shown how willing they are to change prices by the fact it's half the price now! If some fan reviews have the ability to get the price slashed in half I think the mighty Zoella whose product it BELONGS TO could've changed the price if she wanted! 
Yet you’re only calling her out on it 
 when did I say you weren’t entitled to your opinion? I am also entitled to mine 
Yes she could have done it before yesterday, but when she's worked hard on something she thought everyone would like for it to be ruined by retailers, do you really think she's over the moon at the minute? 
How has she lied 
She doesn't have rights to it anymore, are you joking me 
I got my eyes on u
